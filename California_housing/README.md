# California_housing

## 1. About

This project uses various regression algorithms in sklearn module to solve the California housing problem. We tried and compared several models and compared them by visualising their performances using a barplot. The models used are : 
1. ElasticNet 
2. DecisionTreeRegressor 
3. RandomForestRegressor 
4. GradientBoostingRegressor 
5. SupportVectorRegressor 
6. MLPRegressor
