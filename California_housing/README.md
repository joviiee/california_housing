# California_housing

This project uses various regression algorithms in sklearn module to solve the California housing problem. 
We tried and compared several models and compared them by visualising their performances using a barplot.
The models used are :
  ElasticNet
  DecisionTreeRegressor
  RandomForestRegressor
  GradientBoostingRegressor
  SupportVectorRegressor
  MLPRegressor
